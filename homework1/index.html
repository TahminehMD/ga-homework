                width="330"> <span class="first">Yu</span> was highly trusted by Shun, so Shun appointed him to finish
            his father's work, which was to stop the flooding.
            Yu's method was different from his father's:
            he organized people from different tribes
            and ordered them to help him build canals
            in all the major rivers that were flooding and lead the water out to the sea. Yu was dedicated to his work.
            The populace praised his perseverance and were inspired, so much so that other tribes joined in the work.
            Legend says that in the 13 years it took him to successfully complete the work to stop the floods,
            he never went back to his home
            village to stop and rest, even though he passed by his house three times.[8]
            According to the traditional chronology, based upon calculations by Liu Xin, the Xia ruled between 2205 and
            1766 BC. According to the chronology based on the "current text" Bamboo Annals, it ruled between 1989 and
            1558 BC. Comparing the same text with dates of five-planet conjunctions, David Pankenier, supported by David
            Nivison, proposed dates of 1953 and 1555 BC.[2][3][4] The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project, commissioned by
            the Chinese government in 1996, concluded that the Xia existed between 2070 and 1600 BC.

                width="330"> <span class="first">Yu</span> was highly trusted by Shun, so Shun appointed him to finish
            his father's work, which was to stop the flooding.
            Yu's method was different from his father's:
            he organized people from different tribes
            and ordered them to help him build canals
            in all the major rivers that were flooding and lead the water out to the sea. Yu was dedicated to his work.
            The populace praised his perseverance and were inspired, so much so that other tribes joined in the work.
            Legend says that in the 13 years it took him to successfully complete the work to stop the floods,
            he never went back to his home
            village to stop and rest, even though he passed by his house three times.[8]
            According to the traditional chronology, based upon calculations by Liu Xin, the Xia ruled between 2205 and
            1766 BC. According to the chronology based on the "current text" Bamboo Annals, it ruled between 1989 and
            1558 BC. Comparing the same text with dates of five-planet conjunctions, David Pankenier, supported by David
            Nivison, proposed dates of 1953 and 1555 BC.[2][3][4] The Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project, commissioned by
            the Chinese government in 1996, concluded that the Xia existed between 2070 and 1600 BC.

        Archaeological discoveries
    </h2>
    <p>
        <span class="first">Archaeologists</span> have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs that point to the possible existence of the Xia dynasty at locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts. There exists a debate as to whether or not the Erlitou culture was the site of the Xia dynasty, largely centering on whether archeological evidence of urban habitation across the region before the Shang dynasty should be taken as corroboration of the traditional account of a Xia, or expected regardless of the historicity of the Xia due to the trajectory of population growth and agricultural development in the fertile regions of eastern China from the neolithic through early history. Radiocarbon dating places the Erlitou sites at c. 2100 to 1800 BC, providing physical evidence of the existence of a state contemporaneous with and possibly equivalent to the Xia dynasty as described in later classical Chinese historical works.[27] In 1959, a site located in the city of Yanshi was excavated containing large palaces that some archaeologists have claimed to be the capital of the Xia dynasty. Through the 1960s and 1970s, archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs in the same locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts regarding Xia;[28] in 2011, Chinese archaeologists uncovered the remains of an imperial sized palace—dated to about 1700 BC—at Erlitou in Henan, further fueling the discussions about the existence of the dynasty.[29] At a minimum, the era traditionally denoted as the Xia dynasty marked a period of urbanization and agricultural development bridging the late Neolithic cultures and the urban civilization of the Shang dynasty.[28]

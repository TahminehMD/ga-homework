Trulia Landing Returns

In this exercise, we'll be adding some interactivity and responsiveness to the trulia site.  There are four mocks that have been prepared








Hints:
* trulia-grid uses CSS grid.  Can you span multiple grids?
* trulia-grid-item and/or trulia-grid-featured-item use flexbox
* CSS transition timing can be controlled by https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function
* The method querySelectorAll() will return an array of objects that match (whereas querySelector() only returns the first one)
* The method getElementsByClassName will return an array of objects that match the class name
